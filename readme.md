# DarkSky API Demo for Art 405

This is a very basic PHP demo of the DarkSky API. It doesn't include a search form and only accepts geographical coordinates to return weather data. Use it for practicing conditional logic.

## Get Started

Create an account on the [DarkSky Developer&rsquo;s page](https://darksky.net/dev) and get an API key. Enter your API key in the placeholder provided in forecast.php.
